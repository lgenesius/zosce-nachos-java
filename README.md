# Zosce Social Media
A project that I worked for final exam in the Operating System course (COMP6153). This project is about a simple social media which features a functionality to create a post/tweet that could be viewed by all people using Nachos.

## Description
In this project, the user doesn't need an account to create post.
To develop Zosce, I am using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Completely_Heuristic_Operating_System" target="_blank">Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System)</a>.
This is the <a href ="/nachos">Nachos</a>.
