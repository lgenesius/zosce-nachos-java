# Zosce Social Media
A project that I worked for final exam in the Operating System course (COMP6153). This project is about a simple social media which features a functionality to create a post/tweet that could be viewed by all people using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Completely_Heuristic_Operating_System" target="_blank">Nachos</a>.

## Description
To develop Zosce, I am using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Another_Completely_Heuristic_Operating_System" target="_blank">Nachos (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System)</a>.
